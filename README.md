Welcome to the Data Structures & Algorithms Laboratory repository for Savitribai Phule Pune University! This repository contains a collection of practical codes for the Data Structures & Algorithms Laboratory course (210257) in the Second Year of Computer Engineering (2019 Course). Let's explore the world of data structures and algorithms together! :rocket:

🎯 **Course Topics Covered:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers. |
| 2 | Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using chaining with / without replacement. |
| 3 | A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method. |
| 4 | Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. |
| 5 | Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and traverse it using postorder traversal(non recursive) and then delete the entire tree. |
| 6 | There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. |
| 7 | You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures. |
| 8 | Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access probability for each key? |
| 9 | A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword. |
| 10 | Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm implemented in Java demonstrating heap/shell data structure with modularity of programming language. |
| 11 | Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular student. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data. |
| 12 | Company maintains employee information as employee ID, name, designation and salary. Allow user to add, delete information of employee. Display information of particular employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the employee details. Use index sequential file to maintain the data. |
